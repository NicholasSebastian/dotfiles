# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles containing all my configurations for my Linux system, development apps, etc.  
I do use GNU stow but not in a rather unconventional way.  
Make sure to use the included install.py script because my setup involves a weird mix of Stow and regular symbolic links.  
Maybe I'll tidy it up again in the future. But probably uneccessary as it works it the way its supposed to already.

```sh
chmod +x install.py
./install.py
```
